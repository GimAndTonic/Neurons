# Neurons
Simple Demo for one Neuron in a Neuronal Network

The Notebook contains a simple neuron with two inputs and no bias to be trained to match a linear function. The training process will be explained within the process.

# Examples
First example is heavly inspired by Brendan Artley's blog post "Train a Neural Network by Hand, An introduction to the mathematics behind neural networks"

## Requirements
A python requirements.txt for pip can be found in the repository. For the use of anaconda, you can create a new visual environment first and execute the pip command in that clean environment. 

For Visual Studio Code users, I included the following package:
- ipykernel

### Install requirements using anaconda

```
conda create -n neuron-demo python=3.8
conda activate neuron-demo
conda install --file requirements.txt
```


### Install requirements using pip

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
